**Instructions**

1. Fork my repository https://github.com/pierluigi/actions-...
2. Generate a new Personal Access Token with repo permissions https://github.com/settings/tokens
3. Install my Siri Shortcut by following this iCloud link on your iPhone: https://www.icloud.com/shortcuts/0f28733463b94c8fafda83c23801be4d 
4. Open the Shortcuts and change the `USERNAME` and `REPOSITORY` with your own GitHub values (e.g. `pierluigi` and `actions-demo` in this case) inside the `URL` field. Expand the "Get contents of URL" section `Show More ->  Headers - Authorization` and add your own GitHub PAT.

Done! Have fun filing bug reports using Siri ;)
